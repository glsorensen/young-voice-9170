Overall I am happy with how this IC went. I would like to get a little faster so that I can complete all the user stories but I was just a couple of minutes from finishing 4.

I like how I set up the project. I wrote out all the tests first and then went through each user story 1 by 1 to get the tests to pass. I also really worked on my commits making sure I commited after each little part was built. This probably slowed me down a little bit as i had over 30 commits, but I believe it is a good habit to get into. God knows I already have enough commitment issues in my life. ;-)

I need to get quiker at the views and iterating through the objects and it took me a little time to differentiate between the instance and class methods, but I eventually got it and it is making more and more sense.

I will say having the practice IC made this one much easier and I appreciate the reps that it is giving me!
